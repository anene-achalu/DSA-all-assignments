Time and Space Complexity Analysis
Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Bubble Sort	O(n²)	O(1)
Selection Sort	O(n²)	O(1)
Insertion Sort	O(n²)	O(1)

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort: These are simple sorting algorithms with O(n²) time complexity.
Pointer-based sorting allows efficient manipulation of array elements using their addresses.
